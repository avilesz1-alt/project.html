      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span
 style="font-family: Century Gothic;">This site covers the ways in which artists
 have begun to fight back against the unlawful training of A.I. models without the
 proper compensation or credit. Much like the Stanford site, this begins by stating
 that many people have started to take AI companies to court, as well as speaking at
 government hearings, all for the purpose of bringing justice to real artists whose art
 has been stolen. Aside from using the law, there are others who have created new ways to disrupt
 the algorithms training, such as Ben Zhao and his project called Nightshade,or Spawning.ai and
 its resource, Kudurru. Though there are doubts that these tools will hold up against the
 ever-changing advancements in technology, artists like Kelly McKernan are thrilled to give
 A.I. a run for its money. The site concludes with the input from an actual developer of
 A.I., saying that companies should agree to remove an artist from their algorithms, unfrontunely
 in most cases, these pleas fall upon deaf ears.</span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Gothic;"><big><small>Whereas many of the sites had minimal interviews and
      quotes from those being directly affected by A.I., this one provides an in-depth look into their thoughts and opinions, as well
      as what theyve had to go through behind the scenes to make things right. In the beginning, the site gives more information about
      Kelly McKernan, the artist who was mentioned in the previous abstract. After a deep discussion of their struggles so far, including
      being low on rent because of the constant theft, McKernan now partners with other artists to sue Stability AI, the people behind
      Stability Diffusion, for violating the rights of not only the three of them, but a plethora of other creatives, too. The site then
      goes on to discuss Christoph Schuhumann, the man responsible for a gigantic database that trains A.I., who isnt the least bit
      remorseful for whats been done. However, that statement is soon combatted by the defiance of McKernan, who believes real art is
      worth fighting for.</big></td>
